<p id="intro">Thank you for the interest you are taking in Ysgol Gyfun Gymraeg Bryn Tawe. It is a pleasure to present our prospectus to you as potential parents and pupils of the school.</p>
<p>We share the privilege as parents, pupils and staff of contributing to a school that has a strong ethos of aiming for excellence in every aspect of our pupils&rsquo; lives. Our pupils have achieved consistently strong outcomes in their external examination results over time, which allows them to follow a career path of their choice. This is clear evidence of the strong partnership that exists between the school and the community, and we extend a warm invitation to you to become a part of this successful partnership. In this prospectus you will read of the very high expectations we have of ourselves, our parents and our students.</p>
<p>Included in the prospectus is a list of our <em>Aims and Objectives</em> as a school. These form the cornerstone of what we do at Bryn Tawe on a daily basis and we ensure that pupils are at the heart of everything that we do. We provide a safe, stimulating and caring environment where each individual pupil is given the support and encouragement to grow and develop both socially and intellectually.</p>
<p>We are very proud of the learning facilities at the school. Our talented and hard working staff provide high quality opportunities and experiences within lessons, as well as through a wide range of extra-curricular activities, which enriches the lives of our pupils. We have a committed governing body with several members having taken a lead role in establishing the school.</p>
<p>All we expect of our students is a commitment to working hard, a determination to gain as much as they can from their educational experiences at Bryn Tawe, a desire to speak Welsh both in lessons and socially and to conduct themselves in such a way as to give themselves and their peers the best possible opportunity to succeed at school. These expectations are best summarised in our three core principles &ndash; Respect, Welsh Ethos and Resilience.</p>
<p>This handbook is the first step in forging a genuine partnership between your home and the school. Together, we can ensure that your sons and daughters receive the best possible educational provision, which will provide them with a first class start in life. I look forward to developing a positive and successful relationship with you.</p>

<h2 id="transfer">Transfer of pupils from the Partner Primary Schools</h2>
<p>A great deal of preparation is made beforehand to ensure a smooth a transition from our Primary partner schools. We are very aware that transition from Primary school can mean quite a dramatic change for many pupils, therefore, we are very keen to get to know our partner Primary school pupils well before they arrive at Bryn Tawe, so that they settle in as quickly as possible.</p>
<img src="https://www.bryntawe.swansea.sch.uk/images/prospectus-2018/inline/p2-l50.jpg" class="l50" alt="">
<p>As part of our successful transition programme our primary school pupils will visit Bryn Tawe throughout Year 6 on varied activities related to learning and socialising with colleagues and pupils from all the primary schools. These involve animation, science and food technology lessons, an entrepreneurial competition, sport skills sessions and team building activities, &ldquo;taster&rdquo; lessons in a range of subjects and the transition residential course to Llangrannog. You will receive a timetable of all the activities and dates as part of our transition programme.</p>
<h3>October</h3>
<p>Bryn Tawe staff and pupils visit primary schools to share information about the school. Parents&rsquo; evenings are held at the primary schools for us to introduce life at Bryn Tawe.</p>

<img src="https://www.bryntawe.swansea.sch.uk/images/prospectus-2018/inline/p4-r50.jpg" class="r50" alt="">
<p>After gathering the detailed information from our partner primary schools, pupils are placed in classes with the aim of maintaining a balance in terms of the following criteria:</p>

	<li>gender</li>
	<li>ability and achievement</li>

<h2 id="estyn">Estyn Comments &ndash; March 2013</h2>
<img src="https://www.bryntawe.swansea.sch.uk/images/prospectus-2018/inline/p6-r50.jpg" class="r50" alt="">
<p>Ysgol Gyfun Bryn Tawe is an excellent school because:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the school&rsquo;s performance, particularly in key stage 4, over three years, compares very well with that of similar schools;</li>
  <li>there are excellent opportunities for pupils to voice their opinion on all aspects of the school&rsquo;s development; For example, they conduct research and advise teachers on effective and appealing methods of presenting digital technology, and contribute to the resources of the teaching and learning box. This is sector-leading practice.</li>
  <li>the quality and consistency of teaching are exceptional features, and over half of the teaching is excellent;</li>
  <li>there are consistent and effective assessment arrangements across departments that make a significant contribution to pupils&rsquo; progress;</li>
  <li>pupils behave very well within and beyond the classroom; and</li>
  <li>the school&rsquo;s remedial strategies promote excellent behaviour by pupils.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="transport">Transport to School</h2>
<img src="https://www.bryntawe.swansea.sch.uk/images/prospectus-2018/inline/p9-r33.jpg" class="r33" alt="">
<p>Transport is provided by the LA for every catchment area pupil living over three miles away from school (using the most direct, safe walking route to school). Should a problem arise in respect of the organisation of transport parents are asked to contact the School Transport Office at County Hall on 01792 636000. Occasionally, the LA will allow parents living within the three-mile limit to &ldquo;purchase&rdquo; a seat on the bus subject to availability.</p>
<p>Buses will leave the school campus at 3.20pm supervised by school staff.</p>

<h2 id="tl">Teaching and Learning</h2>
<p>Developing teaching is our main priority at the school, in order to support pupils to become:</p>
<img src="https://www.bryntawe.swansea.sch.uk/images/prospectus-2018/inline/p10-r33.jpg" class="r33" alt="">
<ul>
  <li><strong>Ambitious, capable learners who are ready to learn throughout their lives.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Enterprising, creative contributors who are ready to play a full part in life and work.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Ethical, informed citizens who are ready to be citizens of Wales and the world.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Healthy, confident individuals who are ready to lead fulfilling lives as valued members of society.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>As a &lsquo;Curriculum Pioneer School&rsquo; and a &lsquo;Lead Creative School&rsquo;, there is a continual focus on evaluating a wide range of very effective learning and teaching strategies. We have very high expectations that enable every individual pupil to learn to their potential through:</p>
<ul>
  <li>detailed planning of learning in lessons,</li>
  <li>providing creative and interesting activities that inspire pupils to learn and deepen understanding,</li>
  <li>challenging all pupils of all abilities to learn to their potential,</li>
  <li>incisive questioning and strategies that support every pupil to build understanding,</li>
  <li>developing high quality learning practices that are established over time,</li>
  <li>supporting pupils to lead their own learning,</li>
  <li>making very effective use of assessment for learning strategies that support pupils to ensure deep learning and understanding.</li>
</ul>
<img src="https://www.bryntawe.swansea.sch.uk/images/prospectus-2018/inline/p11-l50.jpg" class="l50" alt="">
<p>All learning is underpinned by a well-developed Pastoral Programme focused on the individual. Our purpose is to prepare our students effectively for the opportunities, responsibilities and experiences of life within a bilingual society.</p>
<h3>Key Stage 3</h3>
<p>Our curriculum in Key Stage 3 has been planned using our pupils&rsquo; previous learning in our partner Primary schools. There is a clear focus on developing the Literacy, Numeracy and Digital Competence of all our pupils. As well as ensuring opportunities to develop vital subject knowledge in lessons, pupils are provided with opportunities to learn in a creative manner, to develop independent learning skills and to collaborate and co-operate with peers.</p>
<h3>Year 7</h3>
<img src="https://www.bryntawe.swansea.sch.uk/images/prospectus-2018/inline/p12-r50.jpg" class="r50" alt="">
<p>In Year 7, all pupils will undertake a broad-based curriculum that will be skills and competence based and will equip them to be effective learners and develop the skills for life and lifelong learning. Welsh, English, Maths, Science, Physical Education, Modern Foreign Languages and Design Technology are taught in discrete lessons. All Yr 7 pupils follow the CAMU course, which is a thematic based course with a strong emphasis on developing literacy, numeracy and digital competence within the context of History, Geography, Religious Education, Drama, Art and ICT. Personal and Social Education is delivered via whole school thematic mornings six times a year.</p>
<h3>Key Stage 4</h3>
<p>Compulsory core subjects are studied by every pupil &ndash; Welsh, English, Maths, Science, ICT, Physical Education, Religious Studies and Personal and Social Education. Three options are also chosen from a wide range of academic and vocational subjects within the context of Learning Pathways. We have developed several strong partnerships with local post 14 learning providers in order to offer a progressive learning pathway from KS4 to KS5 in our Sixth Form. Please see the KS4 options booklet for full information on our curriculum offer at KS4.</p>
<img src="https://www.bryntawe.swansea.sch.uk/images/prospectus-2018/inline/p13-l33.jpg" class="l33" alt="">
<h3>Key Stage 5</h3>
<p>We have established a very successful partnership with Ysgol Gyfun G&#x175;yr and created the Bryn Tawe &ndash; G&#x175;yr post 16 partnership that is the main post 16 Welsh medium learning provider within the City and County of Swansea. For full details of our post 16 provision, please ask for a copy of the separate Sixth Form prospectus.</p>

<h2>Personal and Social Education (PSE)</h2>
<p>Our PSE curriculum is delivered through six focus mornings during the year. These sessions focus on developing pupils&rsquo; knowledge on a range of relevant themes as well as the relevant skills that will allow each pupil to make informed and responsible life choices.</p>

<h2 id="sex">Sex Education</h2>
<img src="https://www.bryntawe.swansea.sch.uk/images/prospectus-2018/inline/p14-r50.jpg" class="r50" alt="">
<p>Appropriate and sensible sex education is an important element in the work of the school in preparing students for adult life. Care and sensitivity will be ensured in the delivery of the lessons at the appropriate age for all our pupils. If you wish to withdraw your child from these classes, which may conflict with your religious, cultural or moral beliefs, please make a written application to the Head.</p>
<p><strong>The aims of the policy are:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>to present facts in an objective balanced manner</li>
  <li>to know what is and what is not legal</li>
  <li>to help pupils make informed, reasoned and responsible decisions</li>
  <li>to ensure a moral framework in which students are encouraged to consider the importance of self-restraint, dignity and respect for themselves and others</li>
  <li>to enable pupils to appreciate the benefits of stable family life, and the responsibilities of parenthood</li>
  <li>to be aware of the inherent dangers of casual sex</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="homework">Independent Study and Homework</h2>
<img src="https://www.bryntawe.swansea.sch.uk/images/prospectus-2018/inline/p15-r33.jpg" class="r33" alt="">
<p>All students at Bryn Tawe are responsible for their learning. While the work of staff will support learning, ultimately only the student can ensure success. As part of ensuring success and developing discipline in learning, all students are expected to complete homework and independent study. Regular independent study supports students in working on their own, planning their own time and taking responsibility for their own progress. Success at Key Stages 3, 4 and 5 depends on students mastering these personal study skills.</p>
<img src="https://www.bryntawe.swansea.sch.uk/images/prospectus-2018/inline/p16-l33.jpg" class="l33" alt="">
<p>It is the policy at Bryn Tawe that homework is given on a regular basis with feedback provided by staff. Students are provided with a Student Planner that is checked by subject staff regularly. We request that parents look at these as often as possible and let us know whether a student is spending too much or too little time on homework.</p>
<p>The amount of homework set and time spent on it will vary, but in Year 7 it will normally take between one and one and half hours each evening.</p>
<p>The kind of homework set will also vary; it may include creative writing, problem solving exercises, research work, revision for tests, watching a particular TV programme, internet research, preparing an oral presentation etc.</p>
<img src="https://www.bryntawe.swansea.sch.uk/images/prospectus-2018/inline/p17-r50.jpg" class="r50" alt="">
<h3>The Student Planner</h3>
<p>The planner will play a vital part in the day-to-day contact between home and school. It will provide teachers with a convenient channel of communication through which to praise students for good work and progress, and also to raise concerns with parents. We are currently trialling the &lsquo;Show my Homework&rsquo; app as a digital option to the student planner with years 10 and 11, with a view of extending this to the whole school in 2018-19.</p>
<h2 id="consulting">Consulting with Parents</h2>
<p>We place a great emphasis on consulting with parents. As far as Year 7 students are concerned, this will include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>day-to-day consultation (two-way) by means of the Student Planner</li>
  <li>a consultation evening in October with the Personal Tutor looking at pastoral issues, settling in etc.</li>
  <li>an Interim Subject Report in December with feedback on progress</li>
  <li>a consultation evening with subject staff in looking at progress</li>
  <li>a full written report with detailed progress in each subject.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, as a school, we welcome informal enquiries at any time from parents who wish to discuss their child&rsquo;s educational progress. Should you wish to arrange to meet a member of staff, please telephone or email the school and we shall endeavour to respond as quickly as possible, usually on the same day. We ask parents not to call at the school without first making an appointment.</p>
<img src="https://www.bryntawe.swansea.sch.uk/images/prospectus-2018/inline/p18-c50.jpg" class="c50" alt="">

<h2 id="extra">Extra-Curricular Activities</h2>
<p>We attach great importance to the range of clubs and activities that we offer; we believe that students should be encouraged to develop to the fullest extent their skills, talents and abilities. Not only can these activities provide a lifetime&rsquo;s interest, but also the fulfilment and enjoyment obtained creates an atmosphere that is conducive to positive working relationships. Above all, in a Welsh medium school, the opportunities created through these activities will enable our students to further use Welsh in a wide variety of contexts.</p>
<p>Here are some of the activities offered:</p>
<img src="https://www.bryntawe.swansea.sch.uk/images/prospectus-2018/inline/p19-r33.jpg" class="r33" alt="">

</dl>

<h2 id="support">Support for Student Learning</h2>
<p>If students are to be successful learners they will need support and guidance. The teaching staff will set the expectations of the student at all Key Stages and monitor progress towards them. Should students show signs of failing to reach these expectations, the school will provide a guidance programme, which is specific to the student.</p>
<img src="https://www.bryntawe.swansea.sch.uk/images/prospectus-2018/inline/p20-l50.jpg" class="l50" alt="">
<h3>Meeting the needs of all students</h3>
<p>We want the best for all our students and our pastoral and well being programme is designed to ensure that students lead happy, welladjusted lives in order to succeed by achieving their potential. All pupils&rsquo; work and progress are regularly and carefully evaluated and assessed informally during the term, and formally through unit tests.</p>
<p>Students who show signs of particular abilities or who wish to extend and develop their skills in specific areas will be offered extension and more challenging tasks and activities inside and outside of formal lessons.</p>
<img src="https://www.bryntawe.swansea.sch.uk/images/prospectus-2018/inline/p21-r50.jpg" class="r50" alt="">
<p>Those students who, on the other hand, find certain areas of the curriculum more challenging or who require support for their learning will be given additional resource in the form of focused support sessions and/or coaching from learning mentors as well as support within the learning environment.</p>
<h2 id="aln">Additional Learning Needs (ALN)</h2>
<p>As an inclusive, Rights Respecting School, we believe in providing:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a high quality education for all</li>
  <li>equal educational opportunities for all pupils</li>
  <li>an education that meets the individual needs of all pupils</li>
  <li>The Additional Learning Needs Department have responsibility for identification of pupils via a school-based assessment and audit. This will involve diagnostic assessment, support and monitoring functions.</li>
  <li>Following an assessment, individual pupils will receive specific support to develop their literacy and / or numeracy skills at the appropriate level required for their learning needs.</li>
  <li>In-class support will be focused on those activities, which need specific support and guidance.</li>
  <li>Individual pupils will receive bespoke support for their learning need outside of the mainstream lessons.</li>
  <li>We also provide specific support for pupils in groups to meet their learning needs.</li>
  <li>Pupils will receive specific interventions from the school and outside agencies that will support the more complicated needs of individual pupils e.g. the Educational Psychology Service and the Behaviour Support Unit.</li>
  <li>As well as support to improve learning, pupils also receive interventions to support the development of skills including personal organisation, accepting responsibility, resilience, creative thinking and analysis, team-working, goal setting, planning own learning, recording progress, assessing performance, reflecting on what has been learned and celebrating success.</li>

<h3>The Importance of Parental Participation</h3>
<p>The relationship between Bryn Tawe and its parents is crucial, and this is particularly true in terms of the parents of children with additional learning needs.</p>
<p>We believe it is important that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>parents should be seen as equal partners in the process</li>
  <li>parents are aware of the school&rsquo;s ALN policy</li>
  <li>parents are aware of the support available for ALN children within the school and the LA</li>
  <li>parents are aware of their rights to be involved and of the importance of their contribution</li>
  <li>parents should be given any information on local and national voluntary organisations which might provide information, advice and/or counselling</li>
  <li>parents are involved at all stages of the referral process within school</li>
  <li>parents should be involved at review meetings of referrals as well as Statement Reviews</li>
  <li>parents should feel confident to consult at any time with the SEN  co-ordinator regarding the needs of their child</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="attendance">Attendance</h2>
<img src="https://www.bryntawe.swansea.sch.uk/images/prospectus-2018/inline/p24-r50.jpg" class="r50" alt="">
<p>Regular attendance is essential for effective learning as all absenteeism affects the progress of children in school. As a result, maintaining and improving pupils&rsquo; attendance is one of our main school priorities. We use several effective strategies, including rewards, to support pupils and their families to maintain high levels and improve their attendance. The pastoral team, which includes all form tutors, works very closely with the Education Welfare Officer to help pupils improve attendance.</p>
<p>All absences should be covered by a parental note produced upon the pupil&rsquo;s return to school.</p>

<h3>Appointments</h3>
<img src="https://www.bryntawe.swansea.sch.uk/images/prospectus-2018/inline/p25-r50.jpg" class="r50" alt="">
<p>We request that appointments for doctors and dentists etc. are made, where possible, outside of the school day. If this is unavoidable students must produce a letter signed by a parent / guardian in order to be released from lessons. The letter should be taken to the school office where the student will be given an authorised pass to leave the school premises.</p>
<h3>Family holidays in term time</h3>
<p>We are committed to raising levels of attendance in order to raise levels of achievement. We would ask that holiday arrangements are made in line with school holidays. It is already clear that the strategy of actively discouraging the taking of holidays in term time has resulted in a significant improvement in attendance at Bryn Tawe and across schools in the City and County of Swansea.</p>
<p>The School therefore intends to pursue this strategy as part of its drive to raise attendance. Generally, absences due to holidays during term times will not be authorised by the Headteacher. The Headteacher will consider each request on an individual basis before determining a response. This means that absences due to pupils being taken on holidays during term time without the authorisation of the Headteacher will be recorded as unauthorised.</p>
<h3>Illness</h3>
<p>If a pupil is taken ill whilst at school every effort is made to keep the child comfortable. If students need to take prescribed medication, this should be left in the school office. It is the pupil&rsquo;s responsibility to come to the office in order to take the medication at the appropriate times.</p>
<img src="https://www.bryntawe.swansea.sch.uk/images/prospectus-2018/inline/p26-r50.jpg" class="r50" alt="">
<p>Whenever necessary, we notify parents and the student is taken home. It is the duty of the parents to make arrangements for the pupil to be collected from school and taken home or to the doctor or hospital.</p>
<p>Parents are asked to contact us on the first day of absence and to provide the pupil with an absence note. Unless the school has been informed of the reason of absence, we will contact the home on the first day of absence by text message. In the event of a prolonged absence, the school will make arrangements for work to be sent home where appropriate.</p>

<h2 id="bullying">Bullying</h2>
<p>Bullying can take many forms, both overt and covert. Bullying is contradictory to the ethos of Bryn Tawe and will not be tolerated.</p>
<img src="https://www.bryntawe.swansea.sch.uk/images/prospectus-2018/inline/p27-r50.jpg" class="r50" alt="">
<p>Every student at Bryn Tawe has the right be an individual, and has the right to be educated in a happy, stress-free environment. Pupils who are bullied by whatever means are unlikely to be happy in school, and are likely to be less successful. Through our Anti-Bullying policy we promote respect and tolerance at every opportunity and continually remind our pupils that any bullying type behaviour is not tolerated at the school. We use school and year assemblies, PSE sessions and support the Anti-Bullying week etc. to promote this message strongly.</p>
<p>We will adopt whatever means available to combat bullying. These methods may include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>verbal warning</li>
  <li>restorative circles</li>
  <li>the use of Anti-Bullying contracts</li>
  <li>involvement of parents</li>
  <li>the direct use of sanctions</li>
  <li>interview by the school council</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Any incidents of bullying should be reported immediately by the pupil and/or parents.</em></p>

<h2 id="coc">Bryn Tawe&rsquo;s Code of Conduct</h2>
<p>We have high expectations for the behaviour of our pupils, as is seen in our three core principles under &lsquo;Respect&rsquo;. This means that we ensure negative behaviour does not damage the opportunity for all to learn and be happy at school. This applies to all who work at Bryn Tawe.</p>
<img src="https://www.bryntawe.swansea.sch.uk/images/prospectus-2018/inline/p28-r50.jpg" class="r50" alt="">
<img src="https://www.bryntawe.swansea.sch.uk/images/prospectus-2018/inline/p29-r33.jpg" class="r33" alt="">
<p>As a Restorative School, we have adopted Restorative Practices as a core element to promote positive behaviour within the school community. The aim of Restorative Practice is to develop the community and to manage conflict and tensions by repairing harm and building relationships.</p>
<p>We are very proud of the high standards in Bryn Tawe with regards to respect, courtesy, and behaviour. Through adopting Restorative Practices fully we can ensure:</p>
<ul>
  <li>that pupils are central to the discipline process</li>
  <li>that the positive ethos continues inside and outside of class</li>
  <li>that we continue to develop the positive relationships between pupils and staff as well as between pupils</li>
</ul>
<p>We ensure that all our pupils are clear about our expectations of their behaviour, as is explained in our three core principles. Disrespectful behaviour is not acceptable at Bryn Tawe and firm action will be taken in all cases. Parents will be informed and involved when appropriate and may be asked to come in to discuss any issues.</p>
<p><em>Bryn Tawe is a school where teachers are given the opportunity to teach, and pupils are given the opportunity to learn &ndash; without disruption.</em></p>
<h3>Behaviour consequences</h3>
<img src="https://www.bryntawe.swansea.sch.uk/images/prospectus-2018/inline/p30-r50.jpg" class="r50" alt="">
<p>Should any pupil not meet the high expectations we set at Bryn Tawe, the school may use sanctions such as the ones below, depending on the seriousness of the offence:</p>
<ul>
  <li>subject area detention</li>
  <li>after school detention</li>
  <li>report card &ndash; this will be sent home to be signed</li>
  <li>community service</li>
  <li>a period of exclusion from a specific lesson / subject</li>
  <li>internal exclusion, students will work in silence in isolation for a set period in our fully staffed inclusion room, &lsquo;Y Gilfach&rsquo;</li>
  <li>fixed term or permanent exclusion, for serious offences.</li>
</ul>
<p>We promote a climate where staff or pupils at Bryn Tawe will not tolerate unacceptable behaviour.</p>
<h3>Rewards</h3>
<p>We believe that rewarding pupils is an essential part of developing confidence, positive self image and celebrating success within the school. We take advantage of rewarding pupils for regular and positive use of the Welsh language, outstanding effort, a positive attitude to learning and excellent attendance. This leads to building positive relationships and an ethos where success is celebrated within the school. Rewards are a regular occurrence on a daily basis with formal rewards ceremonies on a monthly or termly basis.</p>
<img src="https://www.bryntawe.swansea.sch.uk/images/prospectus-2018/inline/p31-r50.jpg" class="r50" alt="">
<p>Rewards will include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>reward points</li>
  <li>verbal rewards</li>
  <li>commendations</li>
  <li>written rewards from staff</li>
  <li>written rewards from Head teacher</li>
  <li>certificates</li>
  <li>gift vouchers</li>
  <li>school trips</li>
  <li>Hot Choc Friday with the Head!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>These rewards are available to all.</strong></p>
<h3>Child Protection</h3>
<p>We have clear and comprehensive policies to safeguard all that work and visit Bryn Tawe. The school follows the &ldquo;All Wales Child Protection Procedure 2008&rdquo;. For full details or a copy of the policy please contact the school. If you wish to discuss any safeguarding matter please contact the school&rsquo;s Designated Safeguarding Officer &ndash; Mr Mark Bridgens (Assistant Head) or our Deputy Designated Safeguarding Officer, Mrs Bethan Williams (ALN Co-ordinator).

Their contact details are available from the school - please contact Mrs Eirian Leonard, the school Business Manager for details.</p>
<img src="https://www.bryntawe.swansea.sch.uk/images/prospectus-2018/inline/p32-r50.jpg" class="r50" alt="">
<h3>Health and Safety/School Security</h3>
<p>We will be vigilant in all matters concerning health and safety issues. Risk assessments are carried out both in school and for any off-site activities which have risks associated with them. Accidents involving personal injury are recorded and reported to the school&rsquo;s Health and Safety Officer. The school site is completely fenced with wide ranging CCTV inside and outside the building. Health and Safety audits and action plans are regularly carried out and updated. Health and safety issues are discussed on a regular basis in the meetings of the Governing Body and the Health and Safety sub-committee.</p>

<h3>Smoking</h3>
<img src="https://www.bryntawe.swansea.sch.uk/images/prospectus-2018/inline/p33-r50.jpg" class="r50" alt="">
<p>Following the LA policy, we have adopted a no smoking policy for all pupils, staff and visitors. We know that smoking can seriously damage the health of smokers and that of people in the vicinity. Therefore, smoking, including e-cigarettes is not acceptable anywhere within the grounds of Bryn Tawe.</p>
<h3>Security of personal belongings</h3>
<p>The students are responsible for their personal belongings. We ask students not to bring items of significant value to school. Students will be provided with safe storage for musical instruments. We will endeavour to provide all students with personal lockers. A charge of &pound;3.00 is made for all students who would like a locker at the start of Year 7. The Physical Education staff will have their own security measures for pupils&rsquo; personal belongings.</p>
<h3>Fire Drill</h3>
<p>All pupils will know what to do in case of fire. Posters outlining the procedure will be posted in every teaching and learning room. In order that this procedure is reinforced a Fire Drill will be a regular feature at Bryn Tawe. The school is fortunate in having a sprinkler system.</p>
<img src="https://www.bryntawe.swansea.sch.uk/images/prospectus-2018/inline/p34-r50.jpg" class="r50" alt="">
<h3>Healthy Eating</h3>
<p>The school refectory will provide a cafeteria system where pupils may choose their meals from a set daily menu. We will ensure that there is ample opportunity for pupils to select from a range of healthy and appealing foods.</p>
<h3>Health screening and vaccinations</h3>
<p>During their life at Bryn Tawe pupils will be subject to health screening and vaccinations. You will be informed by letter before such an event and your permission sought.</p>
<h3>Mobile Phones</h3>
<p>The school recognises the usefulness of mobile phones, particularly in times of emergency and also that they can contribute towards educational progress e.g. by using an educational &lsquo;App&rsquo; on a Smartphone. Pupils may use mobile phones in school <strong>under certain defined conditions with permission from a member of staff</strong>. Please see the mobile phone policy for full details. Pupils who are in breach of the policy will have their phones safely retained by staff until parents/guardians are available to collect them. We appreciate the support of parents/guardians in these matters.</p>

<h2 id="council">Bryn Tawe School Council</h2>
<img src="https://www.bryntawe.swansea.sch.uk/images/prospectus-2018/inline/p35-r50.jpg" class="r50" alt="">
<p>As the first Welsh medium school in Wales to achieve Level 1 status as an UNICEF &lsquo;Rights Respecting School&rsquo;, we view the School Council as being central to the school&rsquo;s philosophy of allowing our students to contribute positively to the life of the school. Evidently, there are several educational advantages which pupils can benefit from by playing an active part in the democratic process within the school.</p>
<p>Every pupil that wishes to can apply to represent their fellow pupils on one of our six school councils that have a clear focus in the following areas:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Welsh Ethos Council</li>
  <li>The Environmental and Eco Council</li>
  <li>The Teaching and Learning Council</li>
  <li>The Health and Wellbeing Council</li>
  <li>The E-learning Council</li>
  <li>The Charity and Community Council</li>
</ul>
<img src="https://www.bryntawe.swansea.sch.uk/images/prospectus-2018/inline/p36-r50.jpg" class="r50" alt="">
<p>It is pleasing to see that over 80 pupils have chosen to represent their fellow pupils&rsquo; voice by contributing in an active and meaningful manner to improve these areas of school life. The Senior Prefects sit on the school Governing Body as Pupil Governors.</p>
<p>Amongst the successes of the past few years are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Achieving Stage 5 of the Healthy schools award</li>
  <li>Hosting &lsquo;Networking days&rsquo; with the School Councils of local Swansea schools and our cluster schools</li>
  <li>Achieving the 5th stage of the Healthy Schools award</li>
  <li>Achieving Level 1 of the UNICEF &lsquo;Rights Respecting Schools&rsquo; award</li>
  <li>Organising networking days with Swansea schools and cluster school councils</li>
  <li>Developing the mentoring programme to improve the transition for our year 7 pupils</li>
  <li>Developing the Digital Leaders scheme</li>
  <li>Participation in the selection process of new staff to the school</li>

<h2 id="charging">Charging and Remissions Policy</h2>
<img src="https://www.bryntawe.swansea.sch.uk/images/prospectus-2018/inline/p37-r50.jpg" class="r50" alt="">
<p>In accordance with the appropriate legislation included in the Education Reform Act 1988, the Governing Body of Ysgol Gyfun Gymraeg Bryn Tawe intends that education should be free for pupils if it:</p>
<ul>
  <li>takes place in school hours</li>
  <li>is outside school hours but is required as part of an examination / the National Curriculum / statutory Religious Education</li>
  <li>voluntary contributions may be requested for any of the school&rsquo;s activities. No pupil will be disadvantaged if a parent fails to make this contribution. Naturally, the financial viability of the activity will dictate whether or not it can ultimately be organised.</li>
  <li>The participation in an educational activity outside school hours which is not part of the school&rsquo;s curriculum will be on the basis of parental choice and willingness to meet the charge for that activity.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="equal">Equal Opportunities</h2>
<p>The school is committed to the principle of equality of opportunity to all, irrespective of gender, colour, linguistic background and ability. The school&rsquo;s equal opportunities policy reflects this commitment.</p>

<h2 id="spirit">The School Spiritual Dimension</h2>
<img src="https://www.bryntawe.swansea.sch.uk/images/prospectus-2018/inline/p38-r50.jpg" class="r50" alt="">
<p>In accordance with law, the Religious Education content of the curriculum is provided by means of corporate worship and R.E. lessons given to all pupils. Nevertheless, parents have the right to withdraw their child from these experiences (e.g. other religions) by making a written request to the Head.</p>

<h2 id="hi">Humanitarian Issues and Charity work</h2>
<p>In tandem with the spiritual values of the school, the pupils will be encouraged to develop an interest and to express opinions regarding issues, which affect us as human beings. This may include the adoption of school charities and humanitarian projects.</p>

<h2 id="sport">Sport and Physical Education</h2>
<img src="https://www.bryntawe.swansea.sch.uk/images/prospectus-2018/inline/p39-r50.jpg" class="r50" alt="">
<p>The school is fortunate in being able to enjoy a range of sporting facilities. Pupils will be able to take advantage of the excellent facilities included in the leisure centre situated on the school campus. These include an excellent swimming pool, a sports hall and fitness suites, together with a large, open campus. The school has good quality changing facilities and two gymnasiums for indoor sporting activities.</p>
<p>Everyone is expected to take part in the wide range of activities organised by the P.E. Department. The curriculum will include health and fitness, athletics, gymnastics, dance, hockey, netball, rugby, football, tennis, rounders and crosscountry.</p>
<p>The aim is to allow as many pupils as possible to enjoy as wide a range of sporting and fitness activities as possible.</p>
<p>An emphasis will also be placed on taking part in competitive sport. This will be encouraged through competitions at House, Year, District, County, and all-Wales and British levels.</p>
<p>All pupils are expected to bring the correct kit to all physical education lessons. Any medical conditions which may prevent participation from time to time should be supported by a parental letter / medical certificate.</p>
<p>The school attaches great importance to the development of the whole person, and to instilling healthy practises and attitudes, which will positively influence the pupils&rsquo; lifestyles into adulthood.</p>
<img src="https://www.bryntawe.swansea.sch.uk/images/prospectus-2018/inline/p40-c50.jpg" class="c50" alt="">

<h2 id="careers">Careers Education</h2>
<img src="https://www.bryntawe.swansea.sch.uk/images/prospectus-2018/inline/p41-r50.jpg" class="r50" alt="">
<p>All pupils from Year 8 onwards attend specific lessons in career education and entrepreneurism as part of the PSE curriculum.</p>
<p>Every member of year 11 is entitled to an interview with our 'Careers Wales' careers Officer. We target a small group of pupils in Year 11 to receive further guidance from a &lsquo;Careers Wales&rsquo; officer. Pupils receive continuous support on the different Post 16 pathways available to them and for the personal skills they need. Ysgol Bryn Tawe has an excellent record of ensuring that pupils from all ability ranges make a successful transition to post 16 education, apprenticeships or training. Pupils have benefited greatly from the consultation days held during the curricular transition periods in Year 9 and 11.</p>
<p>On average, around 95% of Ysgol Bryn Tawe's pupils continue in full-time education at the end of KS4. Between 75% - 80% of pupils who leave in Year 13 go on to further education.</p>

<h2 id="complaints">Complaints Procedure</h2>
<p>Parents who are unhappy with anything involving the school should contact us at once. The Head teacher will always meet with concerned parents in order to resolve difficulties. A parent who remains dissatisfied should contact the Chair of Governors.</p>
<p>A complaint of a more serious nature can also be directed to the Education Department, City and County of Swansea, Civic Centre, Oystermouth Road, Swansea SA1 3SN</p>

<h2 id="policy">Access to School Policy Documents</h2>
<p>The school&rsquo;s policies and schemes of work, together with the Welsh Assembly Government&rsquo;s statutory documents on education are available to parents and other interested parties at the school.
